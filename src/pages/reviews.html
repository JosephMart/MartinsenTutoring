{ "title": "Algebra 2, Pre-Cal, AP Cal and SAT Math", "name": "Laurie C.", "text": "Mr. Martinsen has been my son's math (Algebra 2, Pre-Cal, AP Cal and SAT Math) tutor for many years.  As an educator myself, I recognize how important a solid math foundation is to a student, no matter what subject they major in college.  Hollis was recommended to us by a friend.  Hollis has a very flexible schedule and will work with you until you understand the material.  Here are just a few reasons why he may be a good fit for you:

1) Hollis meets his students at their level.  He doesn't waste your time reviewing concepts that you already understand.  He figures out quickly what you already know, and goes from there.

2) Hollis pushes his students to the next level.  My son has always been strong in math, but needed clarity on several topics.  He will push to deeply understand the topic.  He has taken my son to the top of his class.

3)  Excellent SAT Math tutor.  The Math section of the SAT is not only a test of your understanding of math concepts, but also a test of your ability to perform on a timed, standardized test.  For my son, he was able to provide him with test taking strategies that enabled him to get a 740/800 (99th percentile) in the spring of 2017.", "stars": "5", "date": "June 12, 2017"},

{ "title": "College Student", "name": "Victoria G.", "text": "I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to meet and work with Hollis. I was a 24 year old college student in desperate need of a tutor in calculus. Hollis quickly took me under his wing and helped me with academic issues I never even knew I had such as a lack of a better understanding in basic algebra and severe test anxiety. He identified these issues and focused on improving them before helping me improve my higher level math skills. He was very patient with me and if I didn't understand something he didn't make me feel inferior but instead found another way to explain it and didn't move on until I was comfortable. We'd analyze my class work and homework together so that I understood it better to get a good grade. He was extremely flexible especially when I needed him during the week and when it came to tests and finals, he was very good about meeting up with me on test day to go over last minute questions and give a good pep talk. He not only cared about my class, he also cared about my well being. There's no doubt that Hollis is a brilliant man and I couldn't have passed calculus at the University of Houston with out him! I would highly recommend anyone at any grade level looking to improve their academics to go to Hollis. I still hate calculus but Hollis made it bearable! :)", "stars": "5", "date": "June 9, 2017"},

{ "title": "Need a Calculus Tutor", "name": "Melissa C.", "text": "Basically had 5 days to bring up my average for college Cal I in the Summer. Hollis was the first to call me when I placed an interest in tutoring ... and not only that, he made himself readily available everyday after. He had a gigantic challenge with only 5 days before the final. He doesn't just sit there and give you the answers, he works with you and focuses on your weaknesses. He was able to get me to understand concepts that I never understood up until now. I passed Cal I! Highly recommended to use Hollis before going to any other tutor. He is extremely intelligent and is able to explain difficult concepts easily.", "stars": "5", "date": "July 16, 2016"},

His approach is very formalized, he works with your child to ensure they understand the problem so that they are not simply writing down answers. I highly recommend Hollis for math tutoring. As with many service provider's I always take the time to confirm an appointment via text.", "stars": "5", "date": "April 17, 2015"}
